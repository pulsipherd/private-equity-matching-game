# react-memory-game

This is a memory game app built with React. It was built with the purpose of helping people get excited about the private equity process, and driving home the point that Assure can help them move through the process more easily.

## Setup

- Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

- `npm run serve` will run the app at `localhost:4000`. You will notice that hot loading is enabled so changes you make will magically appear without refreshing. (this works for most things but certain state changes you may have to actually refresh). If you install more dependencies you will need to restart the server.
